# AZ_Hydrographer_GWSI_Transducers
Hydrograph Maker for GWSI Data Collected from Automated Sites (Transducers or Stevens Recorders).

Program Author: Justin Clark
Contributors: James Dieckhoff

-This program takes data from an excel file and a text file and creates graphs that stand alone as PNG files.

-The excel files contain water level data and well construction data from wells in ADWRs GWSI database.

-The PNG files generated are saved to the main "Path" Folder.

-This program includes a for loop to make all the PNG files.

-This version (version 1.11) is a clean version that just makes PNG files, does not use Seaborn.

-Pandas and matplotlib are the primary libraries used for this program.


This tool was designed for use by Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) Groundwater Flow 
and Transport Modelers to Process the input data for MODFLOW Models and PEST Calibration Runs.
